# compaction_model
1D compaction modelling code. This code was used in the following publications:
https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021WR031390
PUB 2.

Full documentation is not provided. However, some documentation is available. If you want to use this code, I first recommend reading the papers linked above, then the file "doc2.pdf" in this repository, and finally taking a look at this Tutorial: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haKBICxyVAXzuq2QhCvATNd9tM63Bmg5UTKnSv4fDbg/edit?usp=sharing

If you are still stuck, please reach out to me, letting me know the nature of your project and the issues you are having with the code and I will try and help.

NOTE:
As of March 26th, only required packages to be installed (if using conda) for running the code are:
- pygmt
- seaborn
