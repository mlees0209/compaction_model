	abstract = {Abstract Aquifers are vital groundwater reservoirs for residential, agricultural, and industrial activities worldwide. Tracking their state with high temporal and spatial resolution is critical for water resource management at the regional scale yet is rarely achieved from a single type of groundwater data. Here we show that variations in groundwater levels can be mapped using perturbations in seismic velocity (dv/v). We measure dv/v in the San Gabriel Valley, California, from cross correlation of the ambient seismic field. dv/v reproduces the groundwater level changes that are marked by the multiyear depletions and rapid recharges, typical of California's cycles of droughts and floods. dv/v correlates spatially with vertical surface displacements and deformation measured with the Global Positioning System (GPS). Our results successfully predict the volume of water lost in the San Gabriel Valley during the 2012?2016 drought and thus provide a new, complementary approach to monitor groundwater storage.},

The lack of observations with an adequate spatiotemporal resolution to constrain the evolution of groundwater resources poses severe challenges to water management efforts. Here we present SAR interferometric measurements of high-resolution vertical land motion across the valley, revealing multiscale patterns of aquifer hydrogeological properties and groundwater storage change. Investigating the depletion and degradation of the aquifer-system during 2007-2010, when the entire valley experienced a severe drought, we find that {\textasciitilde}2\% of total aquifer-system storage was permanently lost, owing to irreversible compaction of the system. Over this period, the seasonal groundwater storage change amplitude of 10.11 ± 2.5 km 3 modulates a long-term groundwater storage decline of 21.32 ± 7.2 km 3. Estimates for subbasins show more complex patterns, most likely associated with local hydrogeology, recharge, demand, and underground flow. Presented measurements of aquifer-system compaction provide a more complete understanding of groundwater dynamics and can potentially be used to improve water security.},

	abstract = {Loading and Poroelastic Effects Water in the Earth is stored in oceans, lakes, rivers, groundwater reservoirs, as well as in snowpack, soil, and vegetation. In continental interiors, groundwater and surface water predominate. The mass of water varies seasonally and is large enough to produce displacements of several mm in GPS time series (Herring et al., 2016). The water mass also varies geographically, depending on climate (Fovell and Fovell, 1993) and local geology (Miller, 1994). These mass variations are part of the water cycle. Ground deformation changes in water storage can divided into elastic and poroelastic components. Elastic deformation occurs from water mass changes at the Earth's surface from water bodies (lakes, rivers, etc.) and from snowpack, soil, and vegetation. When there is more precipitation during winter or the rainy season, the water goes into these storage media (Figure 1). The weight of the extra water depresses the ground surface, which deforms elastically in response to the load. In the summer or dry season when evaporation and runoff exceeds precipitation, surface water mass decreases and the earth rebounds, producing uplift (Wahr et al., 2013; van Dam et al., 2001; Meertens et al., 2011). Poroelastic deformation is produced by changes in groundwater storage (Figure 2). Groundwater is stored in aquifers, or formation of porous and permeable sediments and rocks, and aquitards, or formations of low­permeability silts and clay (Miller, 1994). When water is withdrawn from an aquifer or aquitard, pore spaces that were previously supported by water pressure are compacted and overlying ground surface subsides (Galloway et al., 1999). When aquifers are recharged from precipitation or seasonal streamflow, pores open again and the ground surface rises. In aquitards, the compaction is permanent and the resulting subsidence is permanent. Groundwater pumping drives poroelastic deformation in agricultural regions},

Pumping of Central Valley groundwater has produced spectacular land subsidence. Uplift of the adjacent Sierra Nevada mountains has been proposed to be either tectonic uplift or solid Earth's elastic response to unloading of Central Valley groundwater. We find that of the 24 mm of uplift of the Sierra Nevada from October 2011 to October 2015, just 5 mm is produced by Central Valley groundwater loss, less than 2 mm is tectonic uplift, and 17 mm is solid Earth's elastic response to water loss in the Sierra Nevada. We invert GPS vertical displacements recording solid Earth's elastic response to infer changes in water storage across the western U.S. from January 2006 to October 2017. We find water changes to be sustained over periods of drought or heavy precipitation: the Sierra Nevada lost 15 ± 19 km 3 of water during drought from October 2006 to October 2009, gained 18 ± 14 km 3 of water during heavy precipitation from October 2009 to October 2011, and lost 45 ± 21 km 3 of water during severe drought from October 2011 to October 2015 (95\% confidence limits). Such large changes are not in hydrology models: snow accumulation in October is negligible and long-term soil moisture change is small. We infer that there must be large loss of either deep soil moisture or groundwater in river alluvium and in crystalline basement in the Sierra Nevada. The results suggest there to be parching of water in the ground during the summer of years of drought and seeping of melting snow into the Sierra Nevada in the spring of years of heavy precipitation.},

The latter ‘poroelastic’ response of confined aquifers is a well-established phenomenon which has been demonstrated in diverse hydrogeological environments but is frequently ignored in assessments of groundwater resources. Here we present high-frequency groundwater measurements over a twelve-month period from the tropical, fluvio-deltaic Bengal Aquifer System (BAS), the largest aquifer in south Asia. The groundwater level fluctuations are dominated by the aquifer poroelastic response to changes in terrestrial water loading by processes acting over periods ranging from hours to months; the effects of groundwater flow are subordinate. Our measurements represent the first direct, quantitative identification of loading effects on groundwater levels in the BAS. Our analysis highlights the potential limitations of hydrogeological analyses which ignore loading effects in this environment. We also demonstrate the potential for employing poroelastic responses in the BAS and across other tropical fluvio-deltaic regions as a direct, in-situ measure of changes in terrestrial water storage to complement analyses from the Gravity and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission but at much higher resolution.},

MicMac automatically processesimagesfromsynchronizedcameras to computetimeseriesofdigital elevation models (DEMs) and orthorectified images of model surfaces. MicMac also implements digital image correlation to produce high-resolution displacements maps. The resolution of DEMs and displacement maps corresponds to the pixel size of the processed images. Using 24 MP cameras, the precision of DEMs and displacements is {\textasciitilde}0.05mm on a 40×40 cm surface. Processing displacement maps with Matlab® scripts allows automatic fracturemapping on themonitored surfaces.MicMac also offers the possibility to integrate 3-Dmodels of excavated structures with the corresponding surface deformation data.

	abstract = {Abstract We introduce Global Positioning System (GPS) Imaging, a new technique for robust estimation of the vertical velocity field of the Earth's surface, and apply it to the Sierra Nevada Mountain range in the western United States. Starting with vertical position time series from Global Positioning System (GPS) stations, we first estimate vertical velocities using the MIDAS robust trend estimator, which is insensitive to undocumented steps, outliers, seasonality, and heteroscedasticity. Using the Delaunay triangulation of station locations, we then apply a weighted median spatial filter to remove velocity outliers and enhance signals common to multiple stations. Finally, we interpolate the data using weighted median estimation on a grid. The resulting velocity field is temporally and spatially robust and edges in the field remain sharp. Results from data spanning 5?20?years show that the Sierra Nevada is the most rapid and extensive uplift feature in the western United States, rising up to 2?mm/yr along most of the range. The uplift is juxtaposed against domains of subsidence attributable to groundwater withdrawal in California's Central Valley. The uplift boundary is consistently stationary, although uplift is faster over the 2011?2016 period of drought. Uplift patterns are consistent with groundwater extraction and concomitant elastic bedrock uplift, plus slower background tectonic uplift. A discontinuity in the velocity field across the southeastern edge of the Sierra Nevada reveals a contrast in lithospheric strength, suggesting a relationship between late Cenozoic uplift of the southern Sierra Nevada and evolution of the southern Walker Lane.},

We use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis of ERS, Envisat, and ALOS SAR data to resolve 1992-2011 ground deformation in the Santa Clara Valley, California. T-mode principal component analysis successfully isolates temporally variable deformation patterns embedded in the multidecadal time series. The data reveal uplift at 0.4 cm/yr between 1992 and 2000 and {\textless}0.1 cm/yr during 2000-2011, illustrating the end of the aquifer-system's poroelastic rebound following recovery of hydraulic heads after the 1960s low stand. In addition, seasonal elastic deformation with amplitude of up to 3 cm, in phase with head fluctuations, is observed over the confined aquifer sharply partitioned by the Quaternary Silver Creek Fault (SCF). Integration of this deformation with hydraulic head data enables characterization of the aquifer-system storativity and elastic skeletal specific storage. Modeling of the deformation partitioning across the SCF constrains the fault's last tectonic activity, hydraulic conductivity, and material composition. The SCF likely cuts the shallow confining clays and was last active since similar to 140 ka, it has a horizontal hydraulic conductivity several orders of magnitude lower than the surrounding aquifer-system, and is likely composed of clays, making it an effective barrier to across-fault fluid flow. Finally, we show that after a period of calibration, InSAR can be used to characterize basin-wide water level changes without well measurements with an accuracy of 70\%, which demonstrates that it provides useful data for groundwater management.},

Further development, including subsurface geologic information, may allow more quantitative estimates of groundwater change based on InSAR subsidence histories. The aquifer system of the southern Central Valley has both unconfined and confined parts caused by alternating layers of coarse and fine-grained sediments. Snow and surface water are of primary importance in the hydrologic cycle of California, and new techniques are today being applied to their mapping and monitoring.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Increasingly, ground-based and airborne geophysical data sets are used to inform groundwater models. Recent research focuses on establishing coupling relationships between geophysical and groundwater parameters. To fully exploit such information, this paper presents and compares different hydrogeophysical inversion approaches to inform a field-scale groundwater model with time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data. In a sequential hydrogeophysical inversion (SHI) a groundwater model is calibrated with geophysical data by coupling groundwater model parameters with the inverted geophysical models. We subsequently compare the SHI with a joint hydrogeophysical inversion (JHI). In the JHI, a geophysical model is simultaneously inverted with a groundwater model by coupling the groundwater and geophysical parameters to explicitly account for an established petrophysical relationship and its accuracy. Simulations for a synthetic groundwater model and TDEM data showed improved estimates for groundwater model parameters that were coupled to relatively well-resolved geophysical parameters when employing a high-quality petrophysical relationship. Compared to a SHI these improvements were insignificant and geophysical parameter estimates became slightly worse. When employing a low-quality petrophysical relationship, groundwater model parameters improved less for both the SHI and JHI, where the SHI performed relatively better. When comparing a SHI and JHI for a real-world groundwater model and ERT data, differences in parameter estimates were small. For both cases investigated in this paper, the SHI seems favorable, taking into account parameter error, data fit and the complexity of implementing a JHI in combination with its larger computational burden.},

	abstract = {[1] Accurate estimation of the characteristics of the winter snowpack is crucial for prediction of available water supply, flooding, and climate feedbacks. Remote sensing of snow has been most successful for quantifying the spatial extent of the snowpack, although satellite estimation of snow water equivalent (SWE), fractional snow covered area, and snow depth is improving. Here we show that GPS observations of vertical land surface loading reveal seasonal responses of the land surface to the total weight of snow, providing information about the stored SWE. We demonstrate that the seasonal signal in Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center (SOPAC) GPS vertical land surface position time series at six locations in the western United States is driven by elastic loading of the crust by the snowpack. GPS observations of land surface deformation are then used to predict the water load as a function of time at each location of interest and compared for validation to nearby Snowpack Telemetry observations of SWE. Estimates of soil moisture are included in the analysis and result in considerable improvement in the prediction of SWE. Citation: Ouellette, K. J., C. de Linage, and J. S.

As a possible source of these motions, we explored post-seismic viscoelastic relaxation following the 1872 Owens Valley and 1952 Kern County earthquakes with models of laterally homogeneous lower crust and upper mantle viscosity.

	abstract = {In high-altitude alpine catchments, diurnal streamflow cycles are typically dominated by snowmelt or ice melt. Evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycles are less observed in these catchments but might happen simultaneously. During a field campaign in the summer 2012 in an alpine catchment in the Swiss Alps (Val Ferret catchment, 20.4 km2, glaciarized area: 2\%), we observed a transition in the early season from a snowmelt to an evapotranspiration-induced diurnal streamflow cycle in one of two monitored subbasins. The two different cycles were of comparable amplitudes and the transition happened within a time span of several days. In the second monitored subbasin, we observed an ice meltdominated diurnal cycle during the entire season due to the presence of a small glacier. Comparisons between ice melt and evapotranspiration cycles showed that the two processes were happening at the same times of day but with a different sign and a different shape. The amplitude of the ice melt cycle decreased exponentially during the season and was larger than the amplitude of the evapotranspiration cycle which was relatively constant during the season. Our study suggests that an evapotranspirationdominated diurnal streamflow cycle could damp the ice melt-dominated diurnal streamflow cycle. The two types of diurnal streamflow cycles were separated using a method based on the identification of the active riparian area and measurement of evapotranspiration.},

This fault zone exposes numerous NNW-striking, east-facing normal fault scarps that offset seven distinct Quaternary alluvial surfaces and a rockslide deposit. Beryllium-10 cosmogenic radionuclide surface-exposure dating of these surfaces provides surface abandonment model ages of 123.7 ± 16.6 ka, 60.9 ± 6.6 ka, 25.8 ± 7.5 ka, 4.4 ± 1.1 ka, and 4.1 ± 1.0 ka on alluvial fan surfaces, and 18.7 ± 3.9 ka on the rockslide deposit. These age constraints, combined with measurements of vertical surface offset across fault scarps, yield preferred late Pleistocene to Holocene vertical and horizontal extensional slip rates of 0.2-0.3 mm/yr and 0.1-0.2 mm/yr. Vertical slip-rate estimates in this study are comparable to late Pleistocene vertical slip-rate estimates across other prominent range-front normal faults within the Basin and Range Province. These geologic and geochronologic results indicate that the eastern escarpment of the southern Sierra Nevada has remained tectonically active throughout the late Quaternary. Combining our data with slip data from the Owens Valley and Lone Pine faults implies that slip along the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada block is partitioned into three components: dominantly dextral slip along the Owens Valley fault, intermediate oblique slip along the Lone Pine fault, and subordinate normal slip along the Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone. These observations are consistent with global positioning system (GPS) data, which indicate that dextral shear-strain accumulation dominates today along the western boundary of the Eastern California Shear Zone and Basin and Range Province.},

The returned radar echoes from Mars will contain both surface and subsurface reflection components, but the part of the signal is the reflected signal from subsurface layers. To retrieve these weak deep echoes from the radar signal, a signal processing algorithm needs to be developed. A computationally efficient radar signal simulation based on the use of the Facet Method as a surface modeling scheme. This simulator will be used to validate the \{MARSIS\} ground processing software and to support the interpretation of MARSIS data. The first step in the simulation algorithm definition is to model the Mars surface. Many surface modeling methods have been developed and can be found in the literature, but considering the fact that Mars surface is very smooth, the modeling algorithm uses the Facet Method. It is shown that the Facet Method is an efficient scheme for modeling a relatively smooth surface, such as the Mars' surface. The instrument simulation makes strict reference to the \{MARSIS\} radar parameters; however, it may be used to model any radar sounder.},

	abstract = {We use land-subsidence observations from repeatedly surveyed benchmarks and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) in Antelope Valley, California, to estimate spatially varying compaction time constants, tau, and inelastic specific skeletal storage in a previously calibrated regional groundwater flow and subsidence model. The observed subsidence patterns reflect both the spatial distribution of head declines and the spatially variable inelastic skeletal storage coefficient. Using the nonlinear parameter estimation program UCODE we estimate compaction time constants between 3.8 and 285 years. The Skv values are estimated by linear estimation and range from 0 to almost 0.09. We find that subsidence observations over long time periods are necessary to constrain estimates of the large compaction time constants in Antelope Valley. The InSAR data used in this study cover only a three-year period, limiting their usefulness in constraining these time constants. This problem will be alleviated as more SAR data become available in the future or where time constants are small. By incorporating the resulting parameter estimates in the previously calibrated regional model of groundwater flow and land subsidence we can significantly improve the agreement between simulated and observed land subsidence both in terms of magnitude and spatial extent. The sum of weighted squared subsidence residuals, a common measure of model fit, was reduced by 73\% with respect to the original model. However, the ability of the model to adequately reproduce the subsidence observed over only a few years is impaired by the fact that the simulated hydraulic heads over small time periods are often not representative of the actual aquifer hydraulic heads. Errors in the simulated hydraulic aquifer heads constitute the primary limitation of the approach presented here.},

	abstract = {The agricultural productivity of the Central Valley is dependent on the availability of water from irrigation. About 7.3 million acres of cropland in the Central Valley receives about 22 million acre-feet of irrigation water annually. One half of this irrigation water is supplied by ground water, which amounts to about 20 percent of the Nation's ground-water pumpage. Ground water is important as a stable supply of irrigation water because of the high variability of surface-water supplies in the Central Valley. This large ground-water development during the past 100 years has had major impacts on the aquifer system, such as decline in water levels, land subsidence, depletion of the aquifer storage, and increase in recharge. The flow conditions before and during development were simulated on a regional scale using a three-dimensional finite-difference flow model. The concept presented in this report considers the entire thickness of the continental deposits as one aquifer system which has varying vertical leakance that depends on several factors, including amount of fine-grained sediments. The average horizontal hydraulic conductivity is about 6 feet per day, and the average thickness of the continental deposits is about 2,400 feet. The simulation results are shown on maps for comparison with observed hydrologic data. A description of the computer-tape file, which contains estimates of recharge/discharge, and the aquifer properties used in the simulation are included in appendix A and B, respectively. The theoretical basis of calculating borehole hydraulic conductance of multilayer wells which cause increases in vertical leakance during the post-development period is discussed in appendix C.},

	abstract = {Relative crustal uplift observed from 1948-49 to 1967 in the Lower Santa Cruz River Basin in south-central Arizona is attributed at least in part to elastic expansion of the lithosphere induced by the removal, and subsequent loss by evapotranspiration, of 4.35 x 1013 kg of groundwater from alluvium. The area of unloading is approximately 8070 km2. Uplift, relative to an apparently stable area west of the unloaded area, was observed in two areas near Casa Grande and Florence where crystalline bedrock is either close to the land surface or crops out through alluvium from which groundwater was withdrawn. The magnitudes of uplift were approximately 6.3 and 7.5 cm respectively. The observations are based on first-order leveling. The observations are significant at three standard deviations for random surveying errors, and are not believed to be affected by systematic errors. However, the 7.5-cm uplift observed at Florence may be from 1 to 2 cm in excess of the actual uplift because of the possibility of subsidence of a tie point due to groundwater pumping during the leveling in 1948-49. Uplift is attributed to groundwater withdrawal on three bases. First, the observed uplift is consistent with a theoretical evaluation of elastic expansion based on linear elasticity theory. For the observed distribution of unloading and uplift and a Poisson's ratio of 0.25, a Young's modulus for the lithosphere of approximately 0.68 Mbar is implied. This value is comparable to values of the lithosphere reported elsewhere. Second, the magnitude of uplift compares favorably with the magnitude of elastic depression caused by the formation of Lake Mead, Arizona—Nevada, 430 km northwest of the study area, when allowance is made for the different magnitudes and areal distributions of surface (un)loading. And third, in the area near Casa Grande, a reversal in the sense of bedrock displacement form subsidence of tectonic origin to uplift approximately coincided with the beginning of large groundwater overdraft. The uplift from 1948 to 1967 near Casa Grande was preceded from 1905 to 1948 by 7-8 cm of tectonic subsidence; no precise data for the area near Florence are available before 1948. © 1979, Elsevier Inc.

A field approach is used based on a minimal number of 'bulk' parameters. These parameters, which are the transmissivity, the compressibilities of primary and secondary consolidation , and the viscosity of the secondary consolidation, were derived by calibration of the model by means of trial and error simulation of 2 years of records of drawdown and compaction. It was found that in the absence of drawdown records the identification may also be accomplished with compaction records in addition to a standard pumping test. Comparison of computed results with available records shows that the viscoelastic model yields a satisfactory prediction of compaction which is far better than that obtainable with the elastic model of the classical Theis-Jacob approach. The elastic model may be adequate to represent the hydraulic properties of the aquifer in the analysis of the piezometric drawdown; however, it appears to be unsatisfactory to represent the mechanical properties of the aquifer as related to surface subsidence.},

	abstract = {It is known that GPS time series contain a seasonal variation that is not due to tectonic motions, and it has recently been shown that crustal seismic velocities may also vary seasonally. In order to explain these changes, a number of hypotheses have been given, among which thermoelastic and hydrology-induced stresses and strains are leading candidates. Unfortunately, though, since a general framework does not exist for understanding such seasonal variations, it is currently not possible to quickly evaluate the plausibility of these hypotheses. To fill this gap in the literature, I generalize a two-dimensional thermoelastic strain model to provide an analytic solution for the displacements and wave speed changes due to either thermoelastic stresses or hydrologic loading, which consists of poroelastic stresses and purely elastic stresses. The thermoelastic model assumes a periodic surface temperature, and the hydrologic models similarly assume a periodic near-surface water load. Since all three models are two-dimensional and periodic, they are expected to only approximate any realistic scenario; but the models nonetheless provide a quantitative framework for estimating the effects of thermoelastic and hydrologic variations. Quantitative comparison between the models and observations is further complicated by the large uncertainty in some of the relevant parameters. Despite this uncertainty, though, I find that maximum realistic thermoelastic effects are unlikely to explain a large fraction of the observed annual variation in a typical GPS displacement time series or of the observed annual variations in seismic wave speeds in southern California. Hydrologic loading, on the other hand, may be able to explain a larger fraction of both the annual variations in displacements and seismic wave speeds. Neither model is likely to explain all of the seismic wave speed variations inferred from observations. However, more definitive conclusions cannot be made until the model parameters are better constrained.},

	abstract = {Drought struck California during 7 of the 9 years from 2007 to 2015, reducing the state's available water resources. Pumping of Central Valley groundwater has produced spectacular land subsidence. Uplift of the adjacent Sierra Nevada mountains has been proposed to be either tectonic uplift or solid Earth's elastic response to unloading of Central Valley groundwater. We find that of the 24 mm of uplift of the Sierra Nevada from October 2011 to October 2015, just 5 mm is produced by Central Valley groundwater loss, less than 2 mm is tectonic uplift, and 17 mm is solid Earth's elastic response to water loss in the Sierra Nevada. We invert GPS vertical displacements recording solid Earth's elastic response to infer changes in water storage across the western U.S. from January 2006 to October 2017. We find water changes to be sustained over periods of drought or heavy precipitation: the Sierra Nevada lost 15 ± 19 km3 of water during drought from October 2006 to October 2009, gained 18 ± 14 km3 of water during heavy precipitation from October 2009 to October 2011, and lost 45 ± 21 km3 of water during severe drought from October 2011 to October 2015 (95\% confidence limits). Such large changes are not in hydrology models: snow accumulation in October is negligible and long-term soil moisture change is small. We infer that there must be large loss of either deep soil moisture or groundwater in river alluvium and in crystalline basement in the Sierra Nevada. The results suggest there to be parching of water in the ground during the summer of years of drought and seeping of melting snow into the Sierra Nevada in the spring of years of heavy precipitation.},

	abstract = {We introduce Global Positioning System (GPS) Imaging, a new technique for robust estimation of the vertical velocity field of the Earth's surface, and apply it to the Sierra Nevada Mountain range in the western United States. Starting with vertical position time series from Global Positioning System (GPS) stations, we first estimate vertical velocities using the MIDAS robust trend estimator, which is insensitive to undocumented steps, outliers, seasonality, and heteroscedasticity. Using the Delaunay triangulation of station locations, we then apply a weighted median spatial filter to remove velocity outliers and enhance signals common to multiple stations. Finally, we interpolate the data using weighted median estimation on a grid. The resulting velocity field is temporally and spatially robust and edges in the field remain sharp. Results from data spanning 5–20 years show that the Sierra Nevada is the most rapid and extensive uplift feature in the western United States, rising up to 2 mm/yr along most of the range. The uplift is juxtaposed against domains of subsidence attributable to groundwater withdrawal in California's Central Valley. The uplift boundary is consistently stationary, although uplift is faster over the 2011–2016 period of drought. Uplift patterns are consistent with groundwater extraction and concomitant elastic bedrock uplift, plus slower background tectonic uplift. A discontinuity in the velocity field across the southeastern edge of the Sierra Nevada reveals a contrast in lithospheric strength, suggesting a relationship between late Cenozoic uplift of the southern Sierra Nevada and evolution of the southern Walker Lane.},

Borsa et al. use almost imperceptible crustal uplift to estimate the regional water depletion from the drought. Inverting GPS data maps the impact of the drought on local aquifers over the past few years. The deficit so far in the western United States adds up to 240 gigatons of water, the equivalent of a 10-cm layer across the region. Certain areas of California have fared much worse, with local depletions up to five times the regional average.
Science, this issue p. 1587
The western United States has been experiencing severe drought since 2013. The solid earth response to the accompanying loss of surface and near-surface water mass should be a broad region of uplift. We use seasonally adjusted time series from continuously operating global positioning system stations to measure this uplift, which we invert to estimate mass loss. The median uplift is 5 millimeters (mm), with values up to 15 mm in California’s mountains. The associated pattern of mass loss, ranging up to 50 centimeters (cm) of water equivalent, is consistent with observed decreases in precipitation and streamflow. We estimate the total deficit to be {\textasciitilde}240 gigatons, equivalent to a 10-cm layer of water over the entire region, or the annual mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet.
GPS measurements of crustal rebound in the western U.S. quantify drought-induced regional water depletion.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional ground deformation measured with permanent GPS stations in West Africa was used for investigating the hydrological loading deformation associated with Monsoon precipitation. The GPS data were processed within a global network for the 2003–2008 period. Weekly station positions were retrieved with a repeatability (including unmodeled loading effects) of 1–2 mm in the horizontal components and between 2.5 and 6 mm in the vertical component. The annual signal in the vertical component for sites located between 9.6°N and 16.7°N is in the range 10–15 mm. It is consistent at the 3 mm-level with the annual regional-scale loading deformations estimated from GRACE satellite products and modeled with a combination of hydrological, atmospheric, and nontidal oceanic models. An additional 6 month transient signal was detected in the vertical component of GPS estimates at most of the West African sites. It takes the form of an oscillation occurring between September and March, and reaching a maximum amplitude of 12–16 mm at Ouagadougou (12.5°N). The analysis of in situ hydro-geological data revealed a strong coincidence between this transient signal and peak river discharge at three sites located along the Niger River (Timbuktu, Gao, and Niamey). At Ouagadougou, a similar coincidence was found with the seasonal variations of the water table depth. We propose a mechanism to account for this signal that involves a sequence of swelling/shrinking of clays combined with local loading effects associated with flooding of the Niger River.},

	abstract = {A ground-based GPS network has been established over West Africa in the framework of African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) in tight cooperation between French and African institutes. The experimental setup is described and preliminary highlights are given for different applications using these data. Precipitable water vapor (PWV) estimates from GPS are used for evaluating numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and radiosonde humidity data. Systematic tendency errors in model forecasts are evidenced. Correlated biases in NWP model analyses and radiosonde data are evidenced also, which emphasize the importance of radiosonde humidity data in this region. PWV and precipitation are tightly correlated at seasonal and intraseasonal timescales. Almost no precipitation occurs when PWV is smaller than 30 kg m−2. This limit in PWV also coincides well with the location of the intertropical discontinuity. Five distinct phases in the monsoon season are determined from the GPS PWV, which correspond either to transition or stationary periods of the West African Monsoon system. They may serve as a basis for characterizing interannual variability. Significant oscillations in PWV are observed with 10- to 15-day and 15- to 20-day periods, which suggest a strong impact of atmospheric circulation on moisture and precipitation. The presence of a diurnal cycle oscillation in PWV with marked seasonal evolutions is found. This oscillation involves namely different phasing of moisture fluxes in different layers implying the low-level jet, the return flow, and the African Easterly Jet. The broad range of timescales observed with the GPS systems shows a high potential for investigating many atmospheric processes of the West African Monsoon.},

We also estimate total water storage change attributable to groundwater change using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, which should be equivalent to our water balance estimates. Over two drought periods within our 14-1/2 years study period (January 2007 to December 2009 and October 2012 to September 2016), we estimate from our water balance that a total of 16.5 km3 and 40.0 km3 of groundwater was lost, respectively. Our water balance-based estimate of the overall groundwater loss over the 14-1/2 years is −20.7 km3, which includes substantial recovery during nondrought periods The estimated rate of groundwater loss is greater during the recent drought (10.0 ± 0.2 versus 5.5 ± 0.3 km3/yr) than in the 2007–2009 drought, due to lower net inflows, a transition from row crops to trees, and higher crop water use, notwithstanding a reduction in irrigated area. The GRACE estimates of groundwater loss (−5.0 km3/yr for both water balance and GRACE during 2007–2009, and −11.2 km3/yr for GRACE versus −10 km3/yr for water balance during 2012–2016) are quite consistent for the two methods. However, over the entire study period, the GRACE-based groundwater loss estimate is almost triple that from the water balance, mostly because GRACE does not indicate the between-drought groundwater recovery that is inferred from our water balance.},

	abstract = {The groundwater and surface water comprise a single source of water resources. Efficient and sustainable water resource management requires using groundwater and surface water conjunctively. Worldwide, many water shortage problems come from the fact that neither the timing nor the location of precipitation coincide with water demands. Climate change makes this problem even worse. For California particularly, the warming trend is shifting more precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow during winter season, thereby reducing snow pack in Sierra Nevada Mountains. In addition, snowmelt is occurring earlier in spring due to warmer temperatures, therefore reducing the availability of snowmelt water that contributes to stream flow and surface reservoirs during dry summer season. Climate projections also suggest that winter floods will become more frequent, as will hotter and drier summers. The imbalance in time of water distribution within a year (wet, dry season), and between years (wet, dry year), as well as extreme climate events (for example, 1997 California flood, 2012-2014 California mega drought), create great challenges for water resource management. It is especially true when climate change effect is expected to continue.
This study evaluates winter floodplain inundation as a strategy of capturing and storing excess winter flood water beneath Central Valley floor to restore groundwater for local subsurface reservoir development. The parallel, variably saturated flow modeling code, ParFlow, is chosen to model the spatial and temporal patterns of surface water and groundwater interaction in heterogeneous subsurface under floodplain inundation at lower Cosumnes River floodplain. Particularly, the mechanics of groundwater and surface interaction in heterogeneous subsurface is investigated. Capturing and storing excess winter flood water for the development of local subsurface groundwater reservoir and its impact on water resource management is discussed..
Results of this study show that groundwater and surface water interaction under floodplain inundation is controlled by the heterogeneity of subsurface, primarily the connectivity of heterogeneity, as well as flood water inundating dynamics. A local subsurface reservoir can be augmented through floodplain inundation practice. However, its role of mitigating climate change impact on water resource management on a long time frame needs further investigation.},

	abstract = {The Tulare Basin in Central California is a site of intensive agricultural activity and extraction of groundwater, with pronounced ground subsidence and degradation of water resources over the past century. Spatially extensive observations of ground displacements from satellite-based remote sensing allow us to infer the response of the aquifer system to changes in usage and to marked recharge events such as the heavy winter rainfall in 2017. Radar imagery from the Sentinel-1a/b satellites (November 2014 to October 2017) illuminates secular and seasonal trends modulated by changes in withdrawal rates and the magnitude of winter precipitation. Despite the increased precipitation in early 2017 that led to a marked decrease, or in some areas, reversal, of subsidence rates, subsidence returned to rates observed during the drought within a matter of months.

	abstract = {The extraction of groundwater can generate land subsidence by causing the compaction of susceptible aquifer systems, typically unconsolidated alluvial or basin-fill aquifer systems comprising aquifers and aquitards. Various ground-based and remotely sensed methods are used to measure and map subsidence. Many areas of subsidence caused by groundwater pumping have been identified and monitored, and corrective measures to slow or halt subsidence have been devised. Two principal means are used to mitigate subsidence caused by groundwater withdrawal—reduction of groundwater withdrawal, and artificial recharge. Analysis and simulation of aquifer-system compaction follow from the basic relations between head, stress, compressibility, and groundwater flow and are addressed primarily using two approaches—one based on conventional groundwater flow theory and one based on linear poroelasticity theory. Research and development to improve the assessment and analysis of aquifer-system compaction, the accompanying subsidence and potential ground ruptures are needed in the topic areas of the hydromechanical behavior of aquitards, the role of horizontal deformation, the application of differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry, and the regional-scale simulation of coupled groundwater flow and aquifer-system deformation to support resource management and hazard mitigation measures.},

The presented technique is based on an appropriate combination of differential interferograms produced by data pairs characterized by a small orbital separation (baseline) in order to limit the spatial decorrelation phenomena. The application of the singular value decomposition method allows us to easily "link" independent SAR acquisition datasets, separated by large baselines, thus increasing the observation temporal sampling rate. The availability of both spatial and temporal information in the processed data is used to identify and filter out atmospheric phase artifacts. We present results obtained on the data acquired from 1992 to 2000 by the European Remote Sensing satellites and relative to the Campi Flegrei caldera and to the city of Naples, Italy, that demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to follow the dynamics of the detected deformations.},

The area of study was a 4,500 km2 agricultural basin in the San Luis Valley (SLV), Colorado. We had available previous analyses of C-band ERS-1/2 data from June 1992 to November 2000, and L-band ALOS PALSAR data from October 2009 to March 2011. We used C-band Envisat data to fill in the time period from November 2006 to July 2010. In processing the Envisat data, we successfully employed a phase interpolation between persistent scatterer pixels to reduce the impact of vegetation decorrelation, which can significantly reduce the quality of C-band InSAR data over agricultural basins. In comparing the results from the L-band ALOS data and C-band Envisat data in a 10 month overlapping time period, we found that the shorter wavelength of C-band InSAR allowed us to preserve small deformation signals that were not detectable using L-band ALOS data. A significant result was the finding that the elastic storage properties of the SLV confined aquifer system remained stable over the 20 year time period and vary slowly in space, allowing us to combine InSAR data acquired from multiple missions to fill the temporal and spatial gaps in well data. The InSAR estimated head levels were validated with well measurements, which indicate little permanent water-storage loss over the study time period in the SLV.},

	abstract = {In the San Luis Valley (SLV), Colorado legislation passed in 2004 requires that hydraulic head levels in the confined aquifer system stay within the range experienced in the years 1978–2000. While some measurements of hydraulic head exist, greater spatial and temporal sampling would be very valuable in understanding the behavior of the system. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data provide fine spatial resolution measurements of Earth surface deformation, which can be related to hydraulic head change in the confined aquifer system. However, change in cm-scale crop structure with time leads to signal decorrelation, resulting in low quality data. Here we apply small baseline subset (SBAS) analysis to InSAR data collected from 1992 to 2001. We are able to show high levels of correlation, denoting high quality data, in areas between the center pivot irrigation circles, where the lack of water results in little surface vegetation. At three well locations we see a seasonal variation in the InSAR data that mimics the hydraulic head data. We use measured values of the elastic skeletal storage coefficient to estimate hydraulic head from the InSAR data. In general the magnitude of estimated and measured head agree to within the calculated error. However, the errors are unacceptably large due to both errors in the InSAR data and uncertainty in the measured value of the elastic skeletal storage coefficient. We conclude that InSAR is capturing the seasonal head variation, but that further research is required to obtain accurate hydraulic head estimates from the InSAR deformation measurements.},

The Central Valley is a heavily irrigated region with large-scale groundwater depletion during droughts. Here we compare updated estimates of groundwater storage changes in the California Central Valley using GRACE satellites with storage changes from groundwater level data. A new processing approach was applied that optimally uses available GRACE and water balance component data to extract changes in groundwater storage. GRACE satellites show that groundwater depletion totaled ∼31.0 ± 3.0 km3 for Groupe de Recherche de Geodesie Spatiale (GRGS) satellite data during the drought from October 2006 through March 2010. Groundwater storage changes from GRACE agreed with those from well data for the overlap period (April 2006 through September 2009) (27 km3 for both). General correspondence between GRACE and groundwater level data validates the methodology and increases confidence in use of GRACE satellites to monitor groundwater storage changes.},

We measured groundwater pumping-induced land subsidence in the southern Central Valley from March 2015 to May 2017 using Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The InSAR measurements provided fine spatial details of subsidence patterns and displayed a superposition of secular and seasonal variations that were coherent across our study region and correlated with precipitation variability and changes in freshwater demand. Combining InSAR and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, precipitation, and in situ well records showed a broad scale slowdown/cessation of long term subsidence in the wetter winter of 2017, likely reflecting the collective response of the Central Valley aquifer system to heavier-than-usual precipitation. We observed a very good temporal correlation between the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite groundwater anomaly (GWA) variation and long-term subsidence records, regardless of local hydrogeology and mechanical properties. This indicates the subsidence from satellite geodesy is a very useful indicator for tracking groundwater storage change. With the continuing acquisition of Sentinel-1 and other satellites, we anticipate decadal-scale subsidence records with a spatial resolution of tens to hundreds of meters will be available in the near future to be combined with basin-averaged GRACE measurements to improve our estimate of time-varying groundwater change.},

However, the 2007–2010 and 2012–2017 droughts have caused strong increases in groundwater pumping causing land subsidence with strong variability in location, magnitude (total subsidence) and rate of subsidence. In this study, we try to understand what caused these variations. We focus our analyses on three areas: (i) the Westland water district where subsidence was very small during the two drought periods, (ii) ‘El Nido’ area where the greatest subsidence rate was monitored from 2008 to 2010, and (iii) the’ Kings-Tulare counties’ area where the subsidence was small during the 2008–2010 and the largest during 2015–2017 droughts. Our main finding is that land subsidence is located in areas where the water demand for agriculture and the density of groundwater wells is the highest, whereas the rate of subsidence is strongly affected the amount of local and imported surface water and by groundwater resources. Based on these simple observations, we propose using continuous satellite-based ground deformation monitoring and geomechanical modeling to (i) localize areas most prone for future subsidence and (ii) to estimate and manage groundwater resources.},

The lack of observations with an adequate spatiotemporal resolution to constrain the evolution of groundwater resources poses severe challenges to water management efforts. Here we present SAR interferometric measurements of high-resolution vertical land motion across the valley, revealing multiscale patterns of aquifer hydrogeological properties and groundwater storage change. Investigating the depletion and degradation of the aquifer-system during 2007–2010, when the entire valley experienced a severe drought, we find that 2\% of total aquifer-system storage was permanently lost, owing to irreversible compaction of the system. Over this period, the seasonal groundwater storage change amplitude of 10.11 ± 2.5 km3 modulates a long-term groundwater storage decline of 21.32 ± 7.2 km3. Estimates for subbasins show more complex patterns, most likely associated with local hydrogeology, recharge, demand, and underground flow. Presented measurements of aquifer-system compaction provide a more complete understanding of groundwater dynamics and can potentially be used to improve water security.},

	abstract = {We solve for the slip rate distribution on the Hayward fault by performing a least squares inversion of geodetic and seismic data sets. Our analysis focuses on the northern 60 km of the fault. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data from 13 independent ERS interferograms are stacked to obtain range change rates from 1992 to 2000. Horizontal surface displacement rates at 141 bench marks are measured using GPS from 1994 to 2003. Surface creep observations and estimates of deep slip rates determined from characteristic repeating earthquake sequences are also incorporated in the inversion. The fault is discretized into 283 triangular dislocation elements that approximate the nonplanar attributes of the fault surface. South of the city of Hayward, a steeply, east dipping fault geometry accommodates the divergence of the surface trace and the microseismicity at depth. The inferred slip rate distribution is consistent with a fault that creeps aseismically at a rate of ∼5 mm/yr to a depth of 4–6 km. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data require an aseismic slip rate that approaches the geologic slip rate on the northernmost fault segment beneath Point Pinole, although the InSAR data might be complicated by a small dip-slip component at this location. A low slip rate patch of {\textless}1 mm/yr is inferred beneath San Leandro consistent with the source location of the 1868 earthquake.

	abstract = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar remote sensing technique for measuring surface deformation to millimeter-level accuracy at meter-scale resolution. Obtaining accurate deformation measurements in agricultural regions is difficult because the signal is often decorrelated due to vegetation growth. We present here a new algorithm for retrieving InSAR deformation measurements over areas with severe vegetation decorrelation using adaptive phase interpolation between persistent scatterer (PS) pixels, those points at which surface scattering properties do not change much over time and thus decorrelation artifacts are minimal. We apply this algorithm to L-band ALOS interferograms acquired over the San Luis Valley, Colorado, and the Tulare Basin, California. In both areas, the pumping of groundwater for irrigation results in deformation of the land that can be detected using InSAR. We show that the PS-based algorithm can significantly reduce the artifacts due to vegetation decorrelation while preserving the deformation signature.},

In areas where surface water replaced withdrawal of ground-water, water levels in the confined system rose sharply and subsidence slowed. In the late 1960 's and early 1970 's water levels in wells recovered to levels of the 1940 's and 1950 's throughout most of the western and southern parts of the Valley, in response to the importation of surface water through the California aqueduct. During the 1976-77 drought data collected at water-level and extensometer sites showed the effect of heavy demand on the ground-water resevoir. With the ' water of compaction ' gone, artesian head declined 10 to 20 times as fast as during the first cycle of long-term drawdown that ended in the late 1960's. In the 1978-79 water levels recovered to or above the 1976 pre-drought levels. The report suggests continued monitoring of land subsidence in the San Joaquin Valley. (USGS)},

Although the physical processes governing land subsidence are well understood, building predictive models of subsidence is challenging because so much subsurface information is required to do so accurately. For the first time, we integrate airborne electromagnetic data, representing the subsurface, with subsidence data, mapped by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), to model deformation. By combining both data sets, we are able to solve for hydrologic and geophysical properties of the subsurface to effectively model the complex spatiotemporal process of deformation. The resulting model reveals that roughly 3 m of subsidence has occurred at one location of our study area from 1990 to 2018. This model also allows us to predict subsidence more accurately under future hydrologic scenarios, which is needed to develop plans for sustainable groundwater use.},

We use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis of ERS, Envisat, and ALOS SAR data to resolve 1992–2011 ground deformation in the Santa Clara Valley, California. T-mode principal component analysis successfully isolates temporally variable deformation patterns embedded in the multidecadal time series. The data reveal uplift at 0.4 cm/yr between 1992 and 2000 and {\textless} 0.1 cm/yr during 2000–2011, illustrating the end of the aquifer-system's poroelastic rebound following recovery of hydraulic heads after the 1960s low stand. In addition, seasonal elastic deformation with amplitude of up to 3 cm, in phase with head fluctuations, is observed over the confined aquifer sharply partitioned by the Quaternary Silver Creek Fault (SCF). Integration of this deformation with hydraulic head data enables characterization of the aquifer-system storativity and elastic skeletal specific storage. Modeling of the deformation partitioning across the SCF constrains the fault's last tectonic activity, hydraulic conductivity, and material composition. The SCF likely cuts the shallow confining clays and was last active since 140 ka, it has a horizontal hydraulic conductivity several orders of magnitude lower than the surrounding aquifer-system, and is likely composed of clays, making it an effective barrier to across-fault fluid flow. Finally, we show that after a period of calibration, InSAR can be used to characterize basin-wide water level changes without well measurements with an accuracy of 70\%, which demonstrates that it provides useful data for groundwater management.},

This is particularly problematic in regions with a rapidly growing population. In this study, the spatial variability of the thickness of a clay layer, controlling surface – groundwater interactions that affect aquifer vulnerability, was investigated using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). Data were acquired along two transects, showing significant differences in the imaged resistivities. Borehole samples were analyzed regarding particle density and composition, and linked to their resistivity. The obtained relationships were used to translate the field electrical resistivities into lithologies. Those revealed considerable variations in the thickness of the clay layer, ranging from 0m up to 25m. Geochemical data, highlighting zones of increased ingress of surface water into the groundwater, confirmed areas of discontinuities in the clay layer, which act as preferential flow paths. The results may guide urban planning of the Phnom Penh city expansion, in order to supply the growing population with safe water. The presented approach of using geophysics to estimate groundwater availability, accessibility, and vulnerability is not only applicable to Kandal Province, Cambodia, but also to many other areas of fast urbanization in South East Asia and beyond.},

A singular value decomposition (SVD) method is applied to solve the minimum-norm least-squares best fitting estimate of the decorrelation phase for any arbitrary collection of SAR images. This decorrelative phase is then removed from individual interferograms; these corrected interferograms can then be used with existing InSAR time-series analysis algorithms. We demonstrate this method on the Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS PALSAR) scenes of a groundwater pumping subsidence feature in the Central Valley of California and briefly discuss potential future applications of this algorithm to study a variety of environmental and surface physical processes that contribute to InSAR signal decorrelation.},

Because insufficient surface-water supplies are available to meet the growing demand, ground-water pumpage has increased and the resulting water-level declines have raised concern that this water resource may become overstressed. One particular concern is whether the larger ground-water basins within the county function as large individual basins or whether subsurface structures divide these large basins into smaller subbasins, as differences in ground-water-level data suggest. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is used in locating land-surface displacement, which may indicate subsurface structures in ground-water basins by determining seasonal and historical land-surface changes. Owing to the high spatial detail of InSAR imagery, the InSAR-derived displacement maps can be used with ground-water-level data to reveal differential aquifer-system compaction related to the presence of geological structures or the distribution of compressible sediments that may define subbasin boundaries. This report describes InSAR displacement maps of the Paso Robles area of San Luis Obispo County and compares them to maps of seasonal changes in ground-water levels to detect the presence of aquifer-system compaction.},

One approach would be the regional implementation of the airborne electromagnetic (AEM) method. We acquired 104 line-kilometers of data in the Tulare Irrigation District, in the Central Valley, to determine the depth of investigation (DOI) of the AEM method, given the abundance of electrically conductive clays, and to assess the usefulness of the method for mapping the hydrostratigraphy. The data were high quality providing, through inversion of the data, models displaying the variation in electrical resistivity to a depth of approximately 500 m. In order to transform the resistivity models to interpreted sections displaying lithology, we established the relationship between resistivity and lithology using collocated lithology logs (from drillers' logs) and AEM data. We modeled the AEM response and employed a bootstrapping approach to solve for the range of values in the resistivity model corresponding to sand and gravel, mixed coarse and fine, and clay in the unsaturated and saturated regions. The comparison between the resulting interpretation and an existing cross section demonstrates that AEM can be an effective method for mapping the large-scale hydrostratigraphy of aquifer systems in the Central Valley. The methods employed and developed in this study have widespread application in the use of the AEM method for groundwater management in similar geologic settings.},

These targets often correspond to point-wise, man-made objects widely available over a city, but less present in non-urban areas. To overcome the limits of PSInSAR, analysis of interferometric data-stacks should aim at extracting geophysical parameters not only from point-wise deterministic objects (i.e., PS), but also from distributed scatterers (DS). Rather than developing hybrid processing chains where two or more algorithms are applied to the same data-stack, and results are then combined, in this paper we introduce a new approach, SqueeSAR, to jointly process PS and DS, taking into account their different statistical behavior. As it will be shown, PS and DS can be jointly processed without the need for significant changes to the traditional PSInSAR processing chain and without the need to unwrap hundreds of interferograms, provided that the coherence matrix associated with each DS is properly “squeezed” to provide a vector of optimum (wrapped) phase values. Results on real SAR data, acquired over an Alpine area, challenging for any InSAR analysis, confirm the effectiveness of this new approach.},

	abstract = {Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a powerful technology for observing the Earth surface, especially for mapping the Earth's topography and deformations. InSAR measurements are however often significantly affected by the atmosphere as the radar signals propagate through the atmosphere whose state varies both in space and in time. Great efforts have been made in recent years to better understand the properties of the atmospheric effects and to develop methods for mitigating the effects. This paper provides a systematic review of the work carried out in this area. The basic principles of atmospheric effects on repeat-pass InSAR are first introduced. The studies on the properties of the atmospheric effects, including the magnitudes of the effects determined in the various parts of the world, the spectra of the atmospheric effects, the isotropic properties and the statistical distributions of the effects, are then discussed. The various methods developed for mitigating the atmospheric effects are then reviewed, including the methods that are based on PSInSAR processing, the methods that are based on interferogram modeling, and those that are based on external data such as GPS observations, ground meteorological data, and satellite data including those from the MODIS and MERIS. Two examples that use MODIS and MERIS data respectively to calibrate atmospheric effects on InSAR are also given.},

However, little is known of the extent to which individuals in these disciplines experience inappropriate remarks, harassment, and assault. We hypothesized that the multiple marginality of women of color would mean that they would experience a higher frequency of inappropriate remarks, harassment, and assault in the astronomical and planetary science workplace. We conducted an internet-based survey of the workplace experiences of 474 astronomers and planetary scientists between 2011 and 2015 and found support for this hypothesis. In this sample, in nearly every significant finding, women of color experienced the highest rates of negative workplace experiences, including harassment and assault. Further, 40\% of women of color reported feeling unsafe in the workplace as a result of their gender or sex, and 28\% of women of color reported feeling unsafe as a result of their race. Finally, 18\% of women of color, and 12\% of white women, skipped professional events because they did not feel safe attending, identifying a significant loss of career opportunities due to a hostile climate. Our results suggest that the astronomy and planetary science community needs to address the experiences of women of color and white women as they move forward in their efforts to create an inclusive workplace for all scientists.},

Common physical and nonphysical barriers that discourage the full participation of students with disabilities in classroom, laboratory, and field activities are illustrated in this review. In areas of limited reportable data relevant in the geoscience-focused literature, a broader science, technology, engineering, and mathematics perspective is provided. Gaps in the literature were identified to include limited empirical evidence on the effectiveness of inclusive curricular design and the limited opportunities for students with disabilities to participate in advanced, multiday geoscience field trips. The purpose of highlighting this collection of literature is to encourage the use of more equitable and inclusive instructional strategies, including alternative strategies and virtual learning environments that increase access and enhance participation for students with physical and sensory disabilities.},

	abstract = {Time series analysis of InSAR data has emerged as an important tool for monitoring and measuring the displacement of the Earth’s surface. Changes in the Earth’s surface can result from a wide range of phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, variations in ground water levels, and changes in wetland water levels. Time series analysis is applied to interferometric phase measurements, which wrap around when the observed motion is larger than one-half of the radar wavelength. Thus, the spatio-temporal “unwrapping” of phase observations is necessary to obtain physically meaningful results. Several different algorithms have been developed for time series analysis of InSAR data to solve for this ambiguity. These algorithms may employ different models for time series analysis, but they all generate a first-order deformation rate, which can be compared to each other. However, there is no single algorithm that can provide optimal results in all cases. Since time series analyses of InSAR data are used in a variety of applications with different characteristics, each algorithm possesses inherently unique strengths and weaknesses. In this review article, following a brief overview of InSAR technology, we discuss several algorithms developed for time series analysis of InSAR data using an example set of results for measuring subsidence rates in Mexico City.},

To infer aquifer dynamics, we provide a more detailed and joint analysis of deformation and groundwater data. Investigating well data in the Tulare Basin, we find that groundwater levels stabilized before 2015 and show that M\&L’s observed continued subsidence through July 2016 is likely caused by the delayed compaction of the aquitard. Our analysis suggests the observed 2017 transient uplift is not due to recharge of the aquifer system after heavy winter rainfall because it requires an unrealistic vertical hydraulic gradient nearly five orders of magnitude larger than that typical of Tulare Basin. We find that, regardless of the amount of rainfall, transient annual uplifts of {\textasciitilde}3 cm occur in May to June. Using an elastic skeletal storage coefficient of 5 × 10

	abstract = {In recent years, a second generation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite sensor has been designed and, partially, put into operation, leading to an important breakthrough in Earth Science studies. The common characteristics of such new systems are, indeed, a reduced revisit time (as short as a few days) and, in most cases, an improved spatial resolution (as small as a few meters), providing scientists with unprecedented data for the mapping and monitoring of natural and human-induced hazards. This paper provides an overview on the new observational capability offered by the second generation of SAR sensors, especially in the field of ground deformation analysis for mitigating the risk associated with natural and human-induced hazards. In particular, we exploit the high resolution X-band data acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation to show how deformation phenomena characterized by limited spatial extent and extremely fast dynamics can be detected and investigated in details. Whenever possible, we compare the achieved results with those obtained by using data collected by the first generation ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT systems. A comparison with one ALOS satellite dataset is also included. Most of the results, based on the application of Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) techniques, highlight how this technology is not anymore just a sophisticated tool for remotely studying surface deformation phenomena, but it is becoming an operational system for near-real time deformation monitoring. Moreover, we also show how the improved spatial resolution extends the possibility to exploit SAR image amplitude, instead of phase, for direct comparison with optical data and for imaging large deformation episodes, typically associated with strong seismic events, for which DInSAR may fail.},

	abstract = {The changes of the solid Earth in south central Alaska in response to two major glacial fluctuations on different temporal and spatial scales have been estimated and we evaluated their influence on the stress state and ongoing tectonic deformation of the region. During the recent (1993–1995) Bering Glacier surge, a large transfer of ice from the Bagley Ice Field to the Bering Glacier terminus region occurred. We estimated the elastic displacement of the solid Earth due to ice mass redistribution from Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements at sites near the surging glacier. We can account for these displacements by transfer of an ice volume of about 14 km3 from the surge reservoir area to the terminus region. We examined the background seismicity (ML ≥ 2.5) before, during, and after the surge. We found that the occurrence of small earthquakes (ML ≤ 4.0) in the surge reservoir region increased during the surge time interval possibly in response to a decrease in ice mass. This suggests that a small decrease in the vertical stress, σ3, could be enough to modulate the occurrence of small, shallow earthquakes in this dominantly thrust fault setting. During this century the southern Alaska coastal glaciers have been undergoing an overall decrease in volume. Based on our compilation of changes in the extent and thickness of the coastal glaciers between the Malaspina and Bering, we calculated surface displacements due to the Earth's viscoelastic response to annual thinning and to the cumulative retreat over the last 100 years. The uplift of the region due to an average annual thinning rate of 1–6 m/yr in the ablation region is 1–12 mm/yr. For our reference model with a viscosity of 5×1019 Pa s for depths between ≈ 40 and 200 km the total viscoelastic response due to the retreat over the last century may be as much as a couple of meters within the coastal ablation zone near Icy Bay. The maximum decrease in σv between 0 and 10 km was ≈ 1.0 MPa, which is significant in relation to the stress drops in recent earthquakes (≈ 2 to 10 MPa) but small in relation to the estimated tectonic stress magnitude. Therefore the occurrence of an earthquake such as the St. Elias (1979, MS = 7.2) may have been advanced in time; however, most of the ongoing stress accumulation would be primarily due to tectonic forces.},

	abstract = {The dense network of 1,100 continuously operating GPS stations in the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) is providing high quality position time series. Data are processed by PBO Analysis Centers at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and at Central Washington University. The results are combined by the Analysis Center Coordinator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and are made available from the UNAVCO Data Center in Boulder. Analysis software of Langbein, 2008, was used to estimate secular trends and annual variations in the time series. The results were interpreted in terms of hydrological loading and poroelastic effects, from both natural and anthropogenic changes in water storage. The effects of monument stability were also considered. The density of PBO observations allows for the identification of spatial patterns that appear coherent over relatively broad areas. Vertical annual signals of 8-10 mm peak-to-peak amplitude are evident at stations in the mountains of northern and central California and southern Oregon showing peak uplift in October and are correlated to hydrological loading. The vertical elastic loading signal, calculated from the 0.25 by 0.25 degree community Noah land-surface model, fits the annual signal well and appears also to model the secular trends, although the time duration of {\textasciitilde}3 years is still limited. In contrast to mountainous regions, stations in the valleys of California show greater spatial variability ranging from stations with almost no detectable annual signal to stations with very large, 20-30 mm, amplitudes with peak uplift in March. The vertical signals are temporally correlated to ground-water variations caused by pumping for agricultural irrigation and likely are caused by poroelastic effects in the sediments rather than loading. Annual vertical signals in southern California, where not obviously influenced from localized ground-water fluctuations, are small with {\textasciitilde}2 mm amplitude and may be due to unmodeled tropospheric effects on the GPS signal. Overall, the results illustrate the potential value of using dense GPS arrays to assess and improve hydrological modeling.},

Seasonal redistribution of surface mass should deform the Earth, and our calculations using GRACE data suggest vertical deformations of ∼13 mm in the region of greatest flux, the Amazon River Basin. To test the GRACE gravity-hydrology connection, we analyzed GPS data acquired from sites in this region. After accounting for degree 1 variations not observable with GRACE, we find that annual deformation measured with GPS correlates highly with predictions calculated from GRACE measurements. These results confirm the variations in surface water sensed by GRACE, which are significantly larger than those predicted by some hydrology models. The results also demonstrate that GRACE can be an important tool for monitoring deformation of the Earth, and suggest that combined analysis of GRACE and GPS may be a useful approach for estimation of geocenter variations.},

	abstract = {California's millennium drought of 2012–2015 severely impacted the Central Valley aquifer system and caused permanent loss of groundwater and aquifer storage capacity. To quantify these impacts within the southern San Joaquin Valley, we analyze various complementary measurements, including gravity changes from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites; vertical land motion from Global Positioning System, interferometric synthetic aperture radar, and extensometer; and groundwater level records. The interferometric data set acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite only spans the period January 2015 and October 2017, while the other data sets span the entire drought period. Using GRACE observations, we find an average groundwater loss of 6.1 ± 2.3 km3/year as a lower bound estimate for the San Joaquin Valley, amounting to a total volume of 24.2 ± 9.3 km3 lost during the period October 2011 to September 2015. This is consistent with the total volume of 29.25 ± 8.7 km3, estimated using only Global Positioning System deformation data. Our results highlight the advantage of using vertical land motion data to evaluate groundwater loss and thus fill the gaps between GRACE and GRACE-Follow-On missions and complement their estimates. We further determine that 0.4–3.25\% of the aquifer system storage capacity is permanently lost during this drought period. Comparing groundwater level and vertical land motion data following September 2015, we determine an equilibration time of 0.5–1.5 years for groundwater levels within aquitard and aquifer units, during which residual compaction of aquitard and land subsidence continues beyond the drought period. We suggest that such studies can advance the knowledge of evolving groundwater resources, enabling managers and decision makers to better assess water demand and supply during and in-between drought periods.},

	abstract = {We use land-subsidence observations from repeatedly surveyed benchmarks and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) in Antelope Valley, California, to estimate spatially varying compaction time constants, τ, and inelastic specific skeletal storage coefficients, S*kv, in a previously calibrated regional groundwater flow and subsidence model. The observed subsidence patterns reflect both the spatial distribution of head declines and the spatially variable inelastic skeletal storage coefficient. Using the nonlinear parameter estimation program UCODE we estimate compaction time constants between 3.8 and 285 years. The S*kv values are estimated by linear estimation and range from 0 to almost 0.09. We find that subsidence observations over long time periods are necessary to constrain estimates of the large compaction time constants in Antelope Valley. The InSAR data used in this study cover only a three-year period, limiting their usefulness in constraining these time constants. This problem will be alleviated as more SAR data become available in the future or where time constants are small. By incorporating the resulting parameter estimates in the previously calibrated regional model of groundwater flow and land subsidence we can significantly improve the agreement between simulated and observed land subsidence both in terms of magnitude and spatial extent. The sum of weighted squared subsidence residuals, a common measure of model fit, was reduced by 73\% with respect to the original model. However, the ability of the model to adequately reproduce the subsidence observed over only a few years is impaired by the fact that the simulated hydraulic heads over small time periods are often not representative of the actual aquifer hydraulic heads. Errors in the simulated hydraulic aquifer heads constitute the primary limitation of the approach presented here.},

The estimation algorithm incorporates a function penalizing changes far from known well locations, linking the aquifer volume changes to agricultural, industrial, and municipal pumping within the Tulare basin. We show that the range changes are compatible with the hypothesis that the source of aquifer volume changes are variations in effective pressure around documented wells. Specifically, inclusion of the well distance penalty does not degrade the fit to the observations, inversions with and without it both give variance reductions of 99.6\%. The patterns of aquifer volume change vary significantly from the drought year, between October 2015 and October 2016, to a wet year in 2017, and into 2018, a year with near average rainfall. The 2.3 million acre-feet of estimated volume reduction, a lower bound on the amount of water extracted from the basin between October 2015 and 2016, agrees with independent estimates of 1.8 and 2.3 million acre-feet. The aquifer volume reduction is also compatible with a loss of 3.1 km3 (2.5 million acre-feet) in groundwater volume derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data.},

We measured groundwater pumping-induced land subsidence in the southern Central Valley from March 2015 to May 2017 using Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. The InSAR measurements provided fine spatial details of subsidence patterns and displayed a superposition of secular and seasonal variations that were coherent across our study region and correlated with precipitation variability and changes in freshwater demand. Combining InSAR and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, precipitation, and in situ well records showed a broad scale slowdown/cessation of long term subsidence in the wetter winter of 2017, likely reflecting the collective response of the Central Valley aquifer system to heavier-than-usual precipitation. We observed a very good temporal correlation between the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite groundwater anomaly (GWA) variation and long-term subsidence records, regardless of local hydrogeology and mechanical properties. This indicates the subsidence from satellite geodesy is a very useful indicator for tracking groundwater storage change. With the continuing acquisition of Sentinel-1 and other satellites, we anticipate decadal-scale subsidence records with a spatial resolution of tens to hundreds of meters will be available in the near future to be combined with basin-averaged GRACE measurements to improve our estimate of time-varying groundwater change.},

	abstract = {Changes in terrestrial water content cause elastic deformation of the Earth's crust. This deformation is thought to play a role in modulating crustal stress and seismicity in regions where large water storage ﬂuctuations occur. Groundwater is an important component of total water storage change in California, helping to drive annual water storage ﬂuctuations and loss during periods of drought. Here we use direct estimates of groundwater volume loss during the 2007–2010 drought in California's Central Valley obtained from high resolution Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar‐based vertical land motion data to investigate the effect of groundwater volume change on the evolution of the stress ﬁeld. We show that GPS‐derived elastic load models may not capture the contribution of groundwater to terrestrial water loading, resulting in an underestimation of nontectonic crustal stress change. We ﬁnd that groundwater unloading during the drought causes Coulomb stress change of up to 5.5 kPa and seasonal ﬂuctuations of up to 2.6 kPa at seismogenic depth. We ﬁnd that faults near the Valley show the largest stress change and the San Andreas fault experiences only {\textasciitilde}40 Pa of Coulomb stress change over the course of a year from groundwater storage change. Annual Coulomb stress change peaks dominantly in the fall, when the groundwater level is low; however, some faults experience peak stress in the spring when groundwater levels are higher. Additionally, we ﬁnd that periods of increased stress correlate with higher than average seismic moment release but are not correlated with an increase in the number of earthquakes. This indicates groundwater loading likely contributes to nontectonic loading of faults, especially near the Valley edge, but is not a dominant factor in modulation of seismicity in California because the amplitude of stress change declines rapidly with distance from the Valley. By carefully quantifying and spatially locating groundwater ﬂuctuations, we will improve our understanding of what drives nontectonic stress and forces that modulate seismicity in California. Plain Language Summary The earth responds elastically to changes in surface mass such that when mass is added, there is regional sinking of the land surface and when mass is lost, there is regional uplift. These mass changes can disturb the regional stress ﬁeld, which in turn, may inﬂuence earthquake activity. The pattern of these disturbances, though, is controlled by the weight and area of the mass that is applied. Here we consider the mass loss and gain associated with groundwater withdrawal and recharge in California's Central Valley. This allows us to isolate the loading contribution due to groundwater storage change, which is primarily driven by pumping activity in the Central Valley, from that of other hydrologic components and quantify its contribution to stress. In isolating the groundwater component, we can show to what extent human pumping activities on both seasonal and long‐term timescales are disturbing crustal stress and possibly inﬂuencing seismic hazard. We show that seasonal groundwater loss does increase stress along faults in California.},

To infer aquifer dynamics, we provide a more detailed and joint analysis of deformation and groundwater data. Investigating well data in the Tulare Basin, we find that groundwater levels stabilized before 2015 and show that M\&L’s observed continued subsidence through July 2016 is likely caused by the delayed compaction of the aquitard. Our analysis suggests the observed 2017 transient uplift is not due to recharge of the aquifer system after heavy winter rainfall because it requires an unrealistic vertical hydraulic gradient nearly five orders of magnitude larger than that typical of Tulare Basin. We find that, regardless of the amount of rainfall, transient annual uplifts of {\textasciitilde}3 cm occur in May to June. Using an elastic skeletal storage coefficient of 5 × 10

Previous works often assume that inelastic deformation occurs over years while elastic deformation is seasonal. This assumption may not hold for systems where groundwater extraction controls drawdowns and recharge because elastic deformation may not be exclusively seasonal (e.g., drought and recovery periods). Here we present an independent component analysis‐based method for extracting elastic aquifer properties without relying on sedimentary data or on curve ﬁtting of seasonal signal. We applied this method to 2015–2019 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar measurements of deformation in the San Joaquin Valley and show that elastic deformation is always present and captured by IC2 with both seasonal patterns and post drought recovery longer‐term deformation. Independent component analysis is the ﬁrst method which enables isolating elastic deformation and properties even through periods that do not exhibit a clear seasonal signal.},

	abstract = {At the turn of the century, San Francisco was the wealthiest and most important city on the Pacific Coast. With a population of 400,000, it was the eighth largest city in the country and the economic center of the West, largely the result of mining and railroad wealth. Then, in the early dawn of 18 April 1906, the city was rocked awake by a violent earthquake, which, together with the subsequent firestorm, reduced much of the city to ashes and ruins. The 1906 earthquake and subsequent fire remains one of the most devastating natural disasters this nation has known. At least 3000 people were killed, and in San Francisco alone, 225,000 out of the city’s {\textasciitilde}400,000 residents were left homeless (Hansen and Condon, 1989). While the 1906 earthquake marked a seminal event in the history of California, it can also be remembered as the birth of modern earthquake science in the United States. It was the first time that an earthquake was recognized and documented as the result of a recurring tectonic process of strain accumulation and release. Under the leadership of Professor Andrew Lawson, of the University of California (UC)–Berkeley, teams of scientists and engineers spread across the state, carefully collecting and documenting physical phenomena related to the quake. Their exhaustive data and thoughtful conclusions, published in landmark volumes two and four years after the earthquake, together with a complementary report published by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in 1907, led to a number of new discoveries about the cause and effects of earthquakes. These discoveries underlie much of modern seismic hazard analysis.},

Early taut-cable extensometers have been largely superceded by freestanding or counterweighted pipes, which typically have dimensionless strain resolutions of a few parts in 107 , over depths of 200 to 1000 meters. Recording of high-resolution, low-drift compaction and expansion data is critically dependent on minimizing the effects of friction in all components of the system, and on virtually eliminating erroneous thermal and mechanical signals. Long-term records from standard extensometers, in conjunction with water-level piezometers, have made it possible to determine, in-situ, the aquifer-system properties that control land subsidence. Newer extra-high resolution extensometers permit definition of the compressibility and hydraulic conductivity of a thin, individual aquitard by means of a short-term pumping test.},

We examined data over two vegetated regions in the San Francisco Bay Area. The average phases of these pixels clearly show the slip along the Hayward fault, and set upper bounds on any slip along the Bay Area segment of the San Andreas fault.},

The NASMD has collected data from over 30 soil moisture observation networks providing millions of in situ soil moisture observations in all 50 states, as well as Canada and Mexico. It is recognized that the quality of measured soil moisture in NASMD is highly variable because of the diversity of climatological conditions, land cover, soil texture, and topographies of the stations, and differences in measurement devices (e.g., sensors) and installation. It is also recognized that error, inaccuracy, and imprecision in the data can have significant impacts on practical operations and scientific studies. Therefore, developing an appropriate quality control procedure is essential to ensure that the data are of the best quality. In this study, an automated quality control approach is developed using the North American Land Data Assimilation System, phase 2 (NLDAS-2), Noah soil porosity, soil temperature, and fraction of liquid and total soil moisture to flag erroneous and/or spurious measurements. Overall results show that this approach is able to flag unreasonable values when the soil is partially frozen. A validation example using NLDAS-2 multiple model soil moisture products at the 20-cm soil layer showed that the quality control procedure had a significant positive impact in Alabama, North Carolina, and west Texas. It had a greater impact in colder regions, particularly during spring and autumn. Over 433 NASMD stations have been quality controlled using the methodology proposed in this study, and the algorithm will be implemented to control data quality from the other {\textasciitilde}1200 NASMD stations in the near future.},

We also estimate total water storage change attributable to groundwater change using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data, which should be equivalent to our water balance estimates. Over two drought periods within our 14-1/2 years study period (January 2007 to December 2009 and October 2012 to September 2016), we estimate from our water balance that a total of 16.5 km3 and 40.0 km3 of groundwater was lost, respectively. Our water balance-based estimate of the overall groundwater loss over the 14-1/2 years is −20.7 km3, which includes substantial recovery during nondrought periods The estimated rate of groundwater loss is greater during the recent drought (10.0 ± 0.2 versus 5.5 ± 0.3 km3/yr) than in the 2007–2009 drought, due to lower net inflows, a transition from row crops to trees, and higher crop water use, notwithstanding a reduction in irrigated area. The GRACE estimates of groundwater loss (−5.0 km3/yr for both water balance and GRACE during 2007–2009, and −11.2 km3/yr for GRACE versus −10 km3/yr for water balance during 2012–2016) are quite consistent for the two methods. However, over the entire study period, the GRACE-based groundwater loss estimate is almost triple that from the water balance, mostly because GRACE does not indicate the between-drought groundwater recovery that is inferred from our water balance.},

Although no sector has been untouched, impacts so far have varied greatly, reflecting different levels of drought preparedness. Urban areas are in the best shape, thanks to sustained investments in diversified water portfolios and conservation. Farmers are more vulnerable, but they are also adapting. The greatest vulnerabilities are in some low-income rural communities where wells are running dry and in California’s wetlands, rivers, and forests, where the state’s iconic biodiversity is under extreme threat. Two to three more years of drought will increase challenges in all areas and require continued—and likely increasingly difficult—adaptations. Emergency programs will need to be significantly expanded to get drinking water to rural residents and to prevent major losses of waterbirds and extinctions of numerous native fish species, including most salmon runs. California also needs to start a longer-term effort to build drought resilience in the most vulnerable areas.},

	abstract = {A major problem facing hydrologists is how to predict land subsidence. A key to this problem is the development of a reliable method for evaluating aquitard parameters. For assumed values of hydraulic conductivity and storage, vertical compaction and expansion of idealized aquitards can be computed (predicted) by an appropriate diffusion equation from known (projected) water level changes in adjacent aquifers. If water levels within the aquifers are observed and the resulting field compaction and expansion are measured, the parameters themselves can be evaluated. Such field measurements are available at a site near Pixley, California, for the composite behavior of a series of 21 doubly draining aquitards. By means of a linear partial differential equation with constant coefficients within one digital model, average hydraulic conductivity for idealized aquitards was evaluated from the field data to be 3 × 10−3 ft yr−1 (2.9 × 10−9 cm s−1), and average nonrecoverable specific storage was evaluated to be 2.3 × 10−4 ft−1 (7.5 × 10−4m−1). A second model allows parameters of nonrecoverable compaction to be stress dependent by assuming for any single material that the product of hydraulic conductivity and an incremental effective stress is a constant and that the product of nonrecoverable specific storage and past maximum effective stress is a constant. The latter assumption is a standard simplification of laboratory consolidation data; the former is introduced in the present paper. This second model improved simulation of observed compaction and expansion severalfold with virtually no increase in computer time. By using a double transformation of applied stress within the second model to linearize the nonlinear partial differential equation, hydraulic conductivity was evaluated to decrease by more than an order of magnitude during 12 years of record from 3.4 × 10−3 ft yr−1 (3.3 × 10−9 cm s−1) near the midplane of an idealized aquitard to 3.0 × 10−4 ft yr−1 (2.9 × 10−10 cm s−1) near the drainage faces of the idealized aquitard. Average nonrecoverable specific storage was evaluated to decrease from 2.3 × 10−4 ft−1 to 1.9 × 10−4 ft−1 (7.6 × 10−4 m−1 to 6.2 × 10−4 −1). In both models the average recoverable specific storage was evaluated to be 4.6 × 10−6 ft−1 (1.5 × 10−5 m−1).},

	abstract = {Aggregate one-dimensional compaction (consolidation) of a series of aquitards in a compacting aquifer system has been simulated through use of a finite difference representation of the vertical stress distribution within an idealized aquitard. Among the parameters affecting the simulated compaction are two storage coefficients (compressibility values), one for recoverable and the other for nonrecoverable compression. These two storage coefficients introduce a transient heterogeneity within an aquitard that is generally ignored by hydrologists. A computer program with two sets of constant coefficients calculates the daily deformation due to observed changes in applied stress near Pixley, California. Although water levels fluctuate annually, no long-term water level decline occurred near Pixley between January 1, 1959, and February 4, 1971. During this period, 3.19 ft (0.972 m) of compaction was observed. The net difference between simulated and observed compaction on February 4, 1971, was 1.3\% of the observed value. Maximum deviation occurred in mid-1964 and equaled 7\% of the observed compaction.},

These targets often correspond to point-wise, man-made objects widely available over a city, but less present in non-urban areas. To overcome the limits of PSInSAR, analysis of interferometric data-stacks should aim at extracting geophysical parameters not only from point-wise deterministic objects (i.e., PS), but also from distributed scatterers (DS). Rather than developing hybrid processing chains where two or more algorithms are applied to the same data-stack, and results are then combined, in this paper we introduce a new approach, SqueeSAR, to jointly process PS and DS, taking into account their different statistical behavior. As it will be shown, PS and DS can be jointly processed without the need for significant changes to the traditional PSInSAR processing chain and without the need to unwrap hundreds of interferograms, provided that the coherence matrix associated with each DS is properly “squeezed” to provide a vector of optimum (wrapped) phase values. Results on real SAR data, acquired over an Alpine area, challenging for any InSAR analysis, confirm the effectiveness of this new approach.},

InSAR maps with high spatial detail and resolution of range displacement (±10 mm in change of land surface elevation) were developed for a groundwater basin (∼103 km2) in Antelope Valley, California, using radar data collected from the ERS-1 satellite. These data allow comprehensive comparison between recent (1993–1995) subsidence patterns and those detected historically (1926–1992) by more traditional methods. The changed subsidence patterns are generally compatible with recent shifts in land and water use. The InSAR-detected patterns are generally consistent with predictions based on a coupled model of groundwater flow and aquifer system compaction. The minor inconsistencies may reflect our imperfect knowledge of the distribution and properties of compressible sediments. When used in conjunction with coincident measurements of groundwater levels and other geologic information, InSAR data may be useful for constraining parameter estimates in simulations of aquifer system compaction.},

Obtaining accurate deformation measurements in agricultural regions is difficult because the signal is often decorrelated due to vegetation growth. We present here a new algorithm for retrieving InSAR deformation measurements over areas with severe vegetation decorrelation using adaptive phase interpolation between persistent scatterer (PS) pixels, those points at which surface scattering properties do not change much over time and thus decorrelation artifacts are minimal. We apply this algorithm to L-band ALOS interferograms acquired over the San Luis Valley, Colorado, and the Tulare Basin, California. In both areas, the pumping of groundwater for irrigation results in deformation of the land that can be detected using InSAR. We show that the PS-based algorithm can significantly reduce the artifacts due to vegetation decorrelation while preserving the deformation signature.},

We present a time series of change in terrestrial water storage as a function of position in Washington and Oregon estimated using GPS measurements of vertical displacement of Earth's surface. The distribution of water variation inferred from GPS is highly correlated with physiographic provinces: the seasonal water is mostly located in the mountain areas, such as the Cascade Range and Olympic Mountains, and is much smaller in the basin and valley areas of the Columbia Basin and Harney Basin. GPS is proven to be an independent measurement to distinguish between hydrological models. The drought period of 2008–2010 (maximum in 2010) and the recovery period of 2011–2012 in the Cascade Range are well recovered with GPS-determined time-variable monthly water mass series. The GPS-inferred water storage variation in the Cascade Range is consistent with that derived from JPL's GRACE monthly mass grid solutions. The percentage of RMS reduction is 62\% when we subtract GRACE water series from GPS-derived results. GPS-determined water storage variations can fill gaps in the current GRACE mission, also in the transition period from the current GRACE to the future GRACE Follow-on missions. We demonstrate that the GPS-inferred water storage variations can determine and verify local scaling factors for GRACE measurements; in the Cascade Range, the RMS reduction between GRACE series scaled by GPS and scaled by the hydrological model-based GRACE Tellus gain factors is up to 90.5\%.},

This is accomplished by assimilating AMSR-E 36.5 GHz measurements into model predictions of SWE at 90 m spatial resolution using the Ensemble Batch Smoother (EnBS) data assimilation framework. For each water year (WY) from 2003 to 2008, SWE was estimated for the accumulation season (1 October to 1 April) with the assimilation of the measurements in the dry snow season (1 December to 28 February). The EnBS SWE estimation was validated against snow courses and snow pillows. On average, the EnBS accumulation season SWE RMSE was 77.4 mm (13.1\%, relative to peak accumulation), despite deep snow (average peak SWE of 545 mm). The prior model estimate without assimilation had an accumulation season average RMSE of 119.7 mm. After assimilation, the overall bias of the accumulation season SWE estimates was reduced by 84.2\%, and the RMSE reduced by 35.4\%. The assimilation also reduced the bias and the RMSE of the 1 April SWE estimates by 80.9\% and 45.4\%, respectively. The EnBS is expected to work well above tree line and for dry snow.},

We examine groundwater from three different but related perspectives of sustainability science, natural resource governance and management, and Earth System science. An Earth System approach highlights the connections between groundwater and the other parts of the system and how these connections are impacting, or are impacted by, groundwater pumping. Groundwater is the largest store of unfrozen freshwater on Earth and is heterogeneously connected to many Earth System processes on different timescales.

	abstract = {Abstract. The coupled poro-mechanical behaviour of geologic-fluid systems is
fundamental to numerous processes in structural geology, seismology, and
geotechnics, but is frequently overlooked in hydrogeology. Substantial
poro-mechanical influences on groundwater head have recently been highlighted
in the Bengal Aquifer System, however, driven by terrestrial water loading
across the Ganges–Brahmaputra–Meghna floodplains. Groundwater management in
this strategically important fluvio-deltaic aquifer, the largest in southern
Asia, requires a coupled hydro-mechanical approach which acknowledges
poroelasticity. We present a simple partially coupled,
1-D poroelastic model of the
Bengal Aquifer System, and explore the poro-mechanical responses of the
aquifer to surface boundary conditions representing hydraulic head and
mechanical load under three modes of terrestrial water variation. The
characteristic responses, shown as amplitude and phase of hydraulic head in
depth profile and of ground
surface deflection, demonstrate (i) the limits to using water levels in
piezometers to indicate groundwater recharge, as conventionally applied in
groundwater resources management; (ii) the conditions under which piezometer
water levels respond primarily to changes in the mass of terrestrial water
storage, as applied in geological weighing lysimetry; (iii) the
relationship of ground surface vertical
deflection with changes in groundwater storage; and (iv) errors of attribution
that could result from ignoring the poroelastic behaviour of the aquifer.
These concepts are illustrated through application of the partially coupled
model to interpret multi-level piezometer data at two sites in southern
Bangladesh. There is a need for further research into the coupled responses
of the aquifer due to more complex forms of surface loading, particularly
from rivers.},

	abstract = {To model ground water flow in a shallow aquifer underlying a salt marsh, the impact of total stress changes due to tidal loading of the marsh surface on the piezometric head within the aquifer must be considered. If the deformation of the porous medium is negligible, a ground water flow model may be modified to account for the changing total stress. The incorporation of these modifications into the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) numerical model SUTRA is discussed, and example problems for which analytic solutions are available are presented to demonstrate the behavior and validity of the modified model. In addition, the form of the specific pressure storativity term used in the SUTRA model is discussed and modifications of this form are suggested.},

	abstract = {Groundwater-level fluctuations represent hydraulic responses to changes in groundwater storage due to aquifer recharge and drainage as well as to changes in stress that include water mass loading and unloading above the aquifer surface. The latter ‘poroelastic’ response of confined aquifers is a well-established phenomenon which has been demonstrated in diverse hydrogeological environments but is frequently ignored in assessments of groundwater resources. Here we present high-frequency groundwater measurements over a twelve-month period from the tropical, fluvio-deltaic Bengal Aquifer System (BAS), the largest aquifer in south Asia. The groundwater level fluctuations are dominated by the aquifer poroelastic response to changes in terrestrial water loading by processes acting over periods ranging from hours to months; the effects of groundwater flow are subordinate. Our measurements represent the first direct, quantitative identification of loading effects on groundwater levels in the BAS. Our analysis highlights the potential limitations of hydrogeological analyses which ignore loading effects in this environment. We also demonstrate the potential for employing poroelastic responses in the BAS and across other tropical fluvio-deltaic regions as a direct, in-situ measure of changes in terrestrial water storage to complement analyses from the Gravity and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission but at much higher resolution.},
